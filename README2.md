# Zabbix Palo Alto Firewall API Monitoring Template

This template is designed to monitor Palo Alto firewalls through Zabbix using the API. It allows for comprehensive monitoring of Palo Alto devices from A to Z without the need to write custom scripts.

## Why Monitor with the API?

Traditionally, SNMP has been widely used for monitoring, but certain Palo Alto models and versions encounter compatibility issues. This can result in gaps during monitoring with SNMP. To address this problem, the Palo Alto API interface provides more accurate and stable monitoring.

The API allows for more detailed data collection, enabling better tracking of network security measures and resource performance.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Monitor the performance, resources, interfaces, and security measures of Palo Alto firewalls via the API.
- **No Scripts Needed**: This template is easy to install and deploy within Zabbix without the need for custom scripts.
- **High Accuracy**: By directly interacting with the API, more accurate data is gathered.
- **Version and Model Compatibility**: Overcome the compatibility issues often encountered with SNMP by using the API.

## Requirements

To use this template, the following requirements must be met:

- Palo Alto device (with API support)
- Zabbix Server v6.4 or newer
- Zabbix Agent
- API username and password
- Palo Alto API key
